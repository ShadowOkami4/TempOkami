# TempOkami

TempOkami is a Discord bot designed to streamline temporary channel management in Discord servers. It leverages a Client/Server design, where the server is an existing channel that can create temporary channels (clients) upon user request. Temporary channels automatically close if no users are present, helping keep your server organized and clutter-free.

## Features that will be added

- **Client/Server Design**: The bot operates on a Client/Server model, where the server (existing channel) creates temporary channels (clients) upon user request.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands make it easy for server members to create and manage temporary channels.
